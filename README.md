# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Project


## 🔍 Problem Statement
Inaccurate rainfall predictions can impact farming, urban planning, and disaster management. This project aims to analyze weather patterns and build a predictive model using relevant meteorological features.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Rainfall.csv ]
- Features: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Rainfall, etc.
- Target: Rainfall (Yes/No or Amount in mm)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Training ( Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
6. Visualization of Results

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
